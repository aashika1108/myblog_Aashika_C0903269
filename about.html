            <td>During my internship at Softqube Technologies, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of
              frontend development with a primary focus on React.js. As an intern, I contributed to various projects,
              gaining hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
              Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including frontend developers and product managers, to
              understand project requirements and deliver backend solutions that align with business goals.
              This experience equipped me with a deep understanding of backend development using Nest.js, honing my
              ability to create scalable and efficient server-side solutions that meet the demands of modern web
              applications.

            <td>I was a key contributor to the design and development of solid backend solutions at Linear Loop as a
              Backend Engineer, mostly using Nest.js. Making use of my knowledge of server-side technologies, I actively
              participated in the development and deployment of scalable APIs, guaranteeing smooth interaction between
              the front-end and back-end systems.
              Actively participated in the development of frontend components using React.js, demonstrating a solid
              understanding of component-based architecture and state management.
              This internship provided me with a valuable foundation in React.js development, allowing me to contribute
              to the creation of engaging and user-friendly interfaces while working in a collaborative and fast-paced
              environment at Softqube Technologies.
